		A report about "Photographic Memory Puzzle" game.

	The name of the game window has the same title as the game 
"Photographic Memory Puzzle".
	Since I am using images with specific pixel width and height I have chosen not to allow 
the user to resize the frame. My frame is resized automatically when the game is started or when the 
difficulty level is changed.
	I am using two menus with several menu items. I have included JCheckBoxMenuItem and
and JRadioButtonMenuItem. The first one for pausing the game and using sounds, and the second
for choosing between different difficulties.
	The layout managers I have used are BorderLayout for the main window, GridLayout for 
the button on the board and for the labels.
	I am using three dialog windows as well, for the Help and About items and another dialog
pops up when the game finishes. All three of them are modal.
	I have attached listeners to my components. And for the RadioButtonMenuItem I have 
attached item listeners, which are triggered when the state of the button is changed.
	Every button of the board has dynamic modality, they can be selected or they cannot be
selected at particular time. The pause and sound check boxes also have dynamic modality. When a 
game has finished and the user do not want to continue playing, they are disabled. 
	The components I have used are JMenuBar, JMenu, JMenuItem, JCheckBoxMenuItem and
JRadioButtonMenuItem for the menu bar, also JPanel for the container of the frame, JButton for the 
cards on the board and JLabel for the counters of the time and attempts.
